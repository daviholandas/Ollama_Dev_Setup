# Local-only Ollama setup for software development.
# - Global env via systemd **root** override (if run with sudo)
# - Fallback to user-level shell profiles + systemd --user (if no sudo)
# - On-demand model creation with --persona (dev, arch, test, plan, planlite, orch)
# - Cross-platform best-effort (Windows: sets user env via `setx` and PowerShell profile)
#
# Examples:
#   sudo python3 setup_ollama_local_v3.py --global-env --threads 14
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart ollama
#   python3 setup_ollama_local_v3.py --pull --create --persona dev,plan
